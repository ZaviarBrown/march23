## Instructions Part 2

- give every `h2` tag a `font-size` property and a value of 35px (pixel is an absolute unit);
- give every `h1` tag a `font-size` property and a value of 3rem;
    - `3rem` --> 3x the size of the root element (which is `HTML`)
    - if `3em` instead --> 3x the size of the direct parent (`h1` parent would be `main` element)
