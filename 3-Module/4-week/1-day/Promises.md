# I Promise I Will Return A Value

## Promises allow us to

- write async code in a sync manner
- write code that relies on the completion of async code
  - avoids ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥callback hellðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

```js
const callbackHell = () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("It's been 1 seconds");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("It's been 2 seconds");
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("It's been 5 seconds");
      }, 3000);
    }, 1000);
  }, 1000);
};

callbackHell();
```

## A promise comes in one of three states

- `resolved` : a promise that has completed successfully
- `rejected` : a promise that is fails to complete
- `pending` : a promise that is not yet resolved nor rejected

---

### Key functional notes

- A promise takes in a callback function

  - That cb takes two optional arguments, `resolve` and `reject`

- A promise can only succeed or fail once: callbacks will not be invoked multiple times

- A promise cannot change its state from fulfilled to rejected or vice-versa

- A promise is a JavaScript Class and has methods, ie `.then()`

---

## Creating your own promises

If your async function does not automatically return a promise, like `setTimeout`/`setInterval`, you can use the promise constructor

Some async code, like `fetch()`, returns a promise by default. You would NOT use the promise constructor in that case!

```js
const wait = (seconds) => {
  return new Promise(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`It's been ${seconds} seconds`);
    }, seconds * 1000);
  });
};

wait(2);
```

## "I want you to do this, **_then_** do this"

`.then()` allows us to tell a promise what to do immediately after it has been resolved

```js
const wait = (seconds) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve();
    }, seconds * 1000);
  });
};

wait(1)
  .then(() => console.log("It's been 1 second"))
  .then(() => wait(1))
  .then(() => console.log("It's been 2 seconds"))
  .then(() => wait(3))
  .then(() => console.log("It's been 5 seconds"));
```

This allows us to write the same code as before, but in a much more readable fashion!

---

## Passing values through `.then()`

When chaining `.then()`'s together, you will often want to use the final value of one promise in the next promise.

Thankfully, this is super easy to do!

The `resolve()` and `reject()` functions will "return" whatever you pass to them.

The default argument for a `.then()` will be the return value of the previous promise.

```js
const add5AfterPause = (num) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(num + 5);
    }, 1000);
  });
};

add5AfterPause(0).then((sum) => console.log(sum)); // 5
add5AfterPause(0)
  .then((nextNum) => add5AfterPause(nextNum))
  .then((sum) => console.log(sum)); // 10
```

Make sure to be mindful of return values! You may run into unexpected behavior if you're not careful.

```js
add5AfterPause(0)
  // returns 5
  .then((nextNum) => add5AfterPause(nextNum))
  // nextNum = 5, returns 10
  .then((sum) => console.log(sum))
  // sum = 10, console.log() doesn't return anything (undefined)
  .then((anotherNum) => add5AfterPause(anotherNum))
  // anotherNum = undefined, returns NaN (undefined + 5 = NaN)
  .then((thisWontWork) => console.log(thisWontWork)); // NaN
```

We can fix this by simply opening up some curly bois

```js
add5AfterPause(0)
  .then((nextNum) => add5AfterPause(nextNum))
  .then((sum) => {
    console.log(sum); // 10
    return sum;
  })
  .then((anotherNum) => add5AfterPause(anotherNum))
  .then((thisWontWork) => console.log(thisWontWork)); // 15
```

## `return` vs `resolve()`

Although `resolve()` and `return` can often be used interchangeably, they are not always the same and can behave differently

```js
const add5AfterPause = (num) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      //! Comment out one of these to compare
      resolve(num + 5);

      // this prints because resolve does not end function execution
      console.log("After resolve");

      //! Comment out one of these to compare
      // this would not pass 100 to our .then()
      return 100;
    }, 1000);
  });
};

add5AfterPause(0) // After resolve
  .then((nextNum) => add5AfterPause(nextNum)) // After resolve
  .then((sum) => console.log(sum)); // 10
```
