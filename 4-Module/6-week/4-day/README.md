## AuthMe IS your project!

Make sure your API Docs, DB Schema, and AuthMe code are all in the same repo!

Make sure the repo is **_`public`_**.

Add both Kirin and me to your repos as collaborators!

- `brown.zaviar@gmail.com`
- `kirinagcaoili@gmail.com`

Once you're deployed, you're free to start working!

- Make sure you fill out your Kanban cards first!
- It'll help to use them to organize what to work on.

### **_Follow instructions, copy paste, watch the walkthroughs!_**
