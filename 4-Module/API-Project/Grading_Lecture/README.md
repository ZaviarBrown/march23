# Grading Requirements

## Merge your own PR's

If you've been creating PR's and waiting for us to merge them, it's now time to be free üïäÔ∏è

## Reiterating "Exactly"

Seed data values do not need to match

Error values **_`Need To Match Exactly`_**

Extra error keys will pass, but you should aim to match the docs exactly

Week 19 Wednesday has useful readings and practices on error handling

## Think you're done? Ask for a pre-grade

Once you have tested everything on production to the best of your ability, you may ask us to pre-grade your project

- One pre-grade per student
- You'll receive feedback on what needs to be fixed
- Does not count toward your final grade
  - Don't break something after a successful pre-grade!
