## Git started with lecture notes

1. Make sure you're in the folder you want your notes to live in

   - A common place for this is your home directory
     - `cd` + enter

2. Clone our class repo

   - It will automatically be named `march23`, so name it something else if you'd like

   ```zsh
   git clone https://github.com/ZaviarBrown/march23.git optionalFolderName
   ```

3. `cd` into the new directory

   ```zsh
   cd optionalFolderName
   ```

4. Switch to your cohort's branch

   ```zsh
   git checkout PST
   ```

5. Anytime you want to update your notes, pull them down!

   ```zsh
   git pull
   ```

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are what I'll use from now on until forever

They are going to be used **_`everywhere`_**, so start getting used to them now!

- Arrow Functions are always anonymous
  - More on this later ðŸ‘€
- Arrow Functions have implicit return (one line)
- Optional parenthesis for single parameter
- Everything else is the same!

  ```js
  // Multiline
  let multilineName = (name) => {
    return "My name is " + name;
  };
  multilineName("Zaviar");

  // Single Line
  let returnName = (name) => "My name is " + name;
  console.log(returnName("Kirin"));

  // Anonymous callback
  let arr = [1, 2, 3];
  let addOne = arr.map((num) => num + 1);
  console.log(addOne);
  ```
